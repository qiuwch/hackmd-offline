# Web servers

If I want to show something to my friends, I need a web server to host my contents.

When I deleted something, make sure no public links are linking to them.

Here are a few places to store web contents.
- weichaoqiu.com, this is a digital ocean server
- Amazon EC2, it seems I already stopped all my EC2 instances
- Amazon Storage, cheap solution but harder to use than a VPS (digital ocean)
- JHU web server, a lot of storage
