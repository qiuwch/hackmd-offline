# Sleep issue of Weichao

Keep cellphone away from bed. If need to listen to music, use Alexa to control and load the music before going to bed.

Read kindle is a good habit, but check what to read. Not a lot of interesting things to read.

Alarm is not helpful, unless for emergency. Keep a good habit is much useful for alarm.

Keep the room in a comfortable setting, lighting, humidity, cleanness are all important factors for a nice bedroom.
