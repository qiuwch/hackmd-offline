# Regular break

The mac app [breaktime]() supports regular break notification.

There are many [alternatives](http://alternativeto.net/software/breaktime/?platform=mac), I need one especially for windows.

~~Rest is a top-ranking one, let me try the trial of it.~~ can not work well. Right click menu not show up, missing icon file.

RSI prevention tool.

[Workrave](http://alternativeto.net/software/workrave/) probably the best? It is not available for mac. So it is not listed as an alternative for breaktime.
