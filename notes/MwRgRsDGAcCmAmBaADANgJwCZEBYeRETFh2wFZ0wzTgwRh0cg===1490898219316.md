# Cpp basics

The `virtual` keyword and `override` keyword. What if I don't use virtual, what is the difference?

If there is no override, the function won't be involked? `override` is a new keyword in c++11. With the override keyword, it imexplictly declare a virtual function. [see here](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/override)
