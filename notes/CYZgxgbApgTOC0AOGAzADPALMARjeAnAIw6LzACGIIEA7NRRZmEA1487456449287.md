# Thunderbird

Make sure it is new enough to support gmail

Install lightning for calendar support, gContactSync, google calendar source.

Change the email sync setting to the recent 30 days.

How to add google calendar? In the calendar tab, right click the calendar list and choose new calendar. Task list is not important because I use wunderlist. But make sure select all the calendars.

Make sure delete local calendar and only keep google calendar. Otherwise I will add events to my local computer.
