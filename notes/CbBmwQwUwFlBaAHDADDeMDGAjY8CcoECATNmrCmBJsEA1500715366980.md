Demo plan
=========

-------
- Razer Blade (1060) - Run Faster-RCNN + RR

    open projects: 1. Supermarket, 2. Matinee, 3. RR, 4, Arm

Do we have too many screens and too distractive, which one should we start from?

------
- Loopback videos
    Videos we should play continouslly
    - scenes(including urban, suntemple, arch123, market, matinee, RR)
    - applications(stereo, RL, bbox labeling, faster rcnn)
    Use two monitors to play these two respectively?
    
    

    @qiuwch: I am not sure whether I can handle so many devices at the same time.
    
    
- Videos for talk
    Videos that I can play while I mention an idea to someone
    playing the applications videos respectively?
