# The difference and collaboration with AirSim

###### tags: `unrealcv`, `airsim`

AirSim focuses on Robotics simulation. UnrealCV focuses on computer vision. It will take sometime for these two fields to merge. But these two will merge eventually.

There are many things unrealcv and airsim can develop together. Including better RPC library for UE4.
