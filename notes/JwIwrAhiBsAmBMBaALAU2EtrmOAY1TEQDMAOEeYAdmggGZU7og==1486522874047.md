# 2/7 meeting of advanced distributed system

[The email thread about ideas]()

Search: Initial Project Ideas from Last Week

1. 
Explain the real robotics system better.
Vehicle communication.

Ad. stars, Oculus.
What to avoid in the message.

Distributed learning system for Tesla.

WAZE.

Learn how to explain the slides? Learn from Yair.

Where is the challenge from?

2. 
Car-to-Car communication

The scale of the problem.

Update the world model in the car system.

This is an easily distributed system to parallel update the world model.

Real-world problem to solve?? Waze++. The theory is elegant. 车联网？

Emergency vehicle? The infrastructure behind these is the same. It is application-driven and application specific issue needs to be solved

Similiar to Imagine Cup ideas.

Tight movement of cars. Human will slow it down.

Lifetime....

The speed of communication will limit the possibility of the application.

3. Cellu

The similarity of projects and the knowledge sharing.

FCC.

Carefully read all the project proposals.

The security hole in aeroplane communication? The potential attack. A new distributed communication system for the planes.

TODO: Peer-to-peer and mesh network, what is the diff.

Collision avoidance device in aeroplane.

4. The 

A chat room without internet? The app called? 

Internet connection, only one device is connected and others can share the connection?

TODO: remember the names of my classmates, I am very bad with this.

Tethering for computers. Hotspot and the tethering.

Daisy chain?

Mesh network. access mode and the peer mode. The standard organization is much more powerful than search teams in some fields.

This idea four years ago?

TODO: read the proposals, try run the A3C system, the headless mode for the rendering.

5. The stuff from Cornell?
 
ISIS project. 

Previous code.

What is the background of this project???

TODO: How to explain the idea clearly within one minute. People easily lose concentration.

Two ways: 1. people no project, 2. good.

The real application we are facing. We need to make sure what we do is useful for others.

Application background, theoretical background. The design of good things.

How to convince people to use it.


Narrow down the number of projects. Send to the maillist something. Read ahead of time. Suggest slack for the conversation.

6. IPFS.

Distributed file system.

TODO: What is the problem you are solving. Not sure what the real-world challenge is. So the direction is not very clear. I feel seeing myself 10 years ago.

Yes: Problem -> Extend a tool
No: I have a tool -> Let us extend it

The problem is backup?

Come with a technology and the problem of the technology??

Is the problem of a technology important enough that worth investigating time on??

TODO: !!! In the real world, all the devices.
Learn from all of them and teach all of them!!!!


The joke, 1. I did that. 2. In a lifetime.

FIFA 17 tournament.

Bitcoin and the block-chain

The problem of the bitcoin, the block chain is too slow. The concensus algorithm (distribute this). The domain of the crpyto. zero-coin.
