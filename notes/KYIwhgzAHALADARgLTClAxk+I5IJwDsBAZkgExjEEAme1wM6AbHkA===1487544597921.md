# VDL required resources

###### tags: `VDL`

## What is available 

- [The MARCC cluster](http://www.marcc.jhu.edu/), need to check how to get more accounts from the MARCC. There should be sufficient computing power to run 12+ complex virtual environments at the same time. Also, will we be able to control individual machines within the cluster?

Here is [some notes about how to use MARCC](https://hackmd.io/JwIwLGCsBmAcAmBaWkDsAGRZX2okAbAZqoQIYBMFkAjAWAKbxA==)

- Machines in Alanlab

We need some machines to do experiments, it is better to have more so that we are free to choose. The computational resources of Alanlab will be hard to access around Mar 17, 2017 (a major conference deadline). After that we can have a lot of computational resources from Alan.

## What we need?

ugrad lab machines for simple environments as a start.

Control over MARCC cluster individual machines to run complex environments.

Also include a few machines we have: weichao (two workstations + one laptop)
