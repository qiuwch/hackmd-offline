    - How do you plan to use Github in your research group?
    
    In our lab, we use github extensively to host our research projects. Some of our projects are open-source, such as https://github.com/unrealcv/unrealcv. Some are not for various reasons, such as: not mature enough or contains information that not suitable to be public.  An organization account can help us organize projects better. It is easier to collaborate on private research repositories between lab members with an organization and we will open source our projects when ready.
