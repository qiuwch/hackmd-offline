# Request a github organization account

Github is very useful for collaboration on code project. It is completely free open-source projects but costs money for private (none-open-source) projects. In our lab, we have some projects that are not open-source for various reasons, such as: not mature enough or contains information that not suitable to be public. Currently we use private project and for each project we need to invite team members. This is tedious. The organization account is a solution for this problem. The private projects underneath an organization account can be shared by all the members of this organization. 

An organization account without education discount. [The price](https://github.com/blog/2164-introducing-unlimited-private-repositories) is "Organization: $9/user/month, $25/month for your first five users". Considering the size of our lab, it will cost us more than $100 each month to maintain an organization account.

Github provides an education discount, making it possible to have free organization account. I tried to apply the discount as a student but got rejected.

Here are [the steps for applying it](https://hackmd.io/EYQwnADGAsBmAmBaWIDGZHQGywMyLFWnxAA4J5oBGAJmgFMbUIg=).
