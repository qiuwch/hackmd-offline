# Done: What to discuss with Oculus?

- The research goal of Oculus research
- Their opinion about synthetic data
- What they want from me?
- What can I provide for them?
- Their opinion about open source? Do they want to share?
- Are their research related to AI? Compare with Baidu?

My strength, background with computer vision and computer graphics, clear about this field. Many ideas to do. Have an open source project with good potential.
