# TODO: Stochastic shape generation

Need to have a [discussion what is the expected shapes from a generation?](https://hackmd.io/OwQwnAZgLBAcDMBaADAE2BRVVWI8ArGIqgMbBRQBGB8wpBAjEA==)

[Some images generated by Qi Chen](https://hackmd.io/GwIw7AxgDAZgrAQwLQBYIiqlBmAHEgTlyhCWFwgEYoAmAUzggBNKCg==)

TODO: the input needs to be pre-segmented, where to get pre-segmented models

contact Siyuan, Qi Chen and undergraduates, might need Alan's help to push forward the progress.

The framework for this data generation tool. The pipeline looks like this.

how to manipulate the graph -> scene graph representation -> export to obj file.

Some examples and related resources.

Should the shapes be semantically meaningful? Embroyo type?

## The message from Misha

[Vangelis Kalogerakis](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~kalo/) has done some work on learning probabilistic models for shape synthesis (e.g., [this paper](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~kalo/papers/ShapeSynthesis/index.html) can synthesize many shapes from segmented training examples). They require consistently segmented result, and there are many techniques that try to do that (including their more [recent paper](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~hbhuang/publications/bsm/)). Perhaps some of his recent work on [style transfer](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~zlun/papers/StyleTransfer/) is also relevant.

[Niloy Mitra](http://geometry.cs.ucl.ac.uk/publications.php) also worked on part-based modeling with more complex structures (e.g., [see replaceable structures work](http://geometry.cs.ucl.ac.uk/projects/2015/replaceable-structures/) or his work on [smart variations](http://vecg.cs.ucl.ac.uk/Projects/SmartGeometry/sFarr/sFarr_eg13.html)).

[Peter Wonka](http://peterwonka.net/Publications/publications.html) has some relevant work on learning buildings / cities grammars from examples (I found [this paper](http://peterwonka.net/Publications/pdfs/2015.SG.Paul.LearningGeometricRelationships.pdf), but I think there might be more relevant references on his website).


## Code

It is worth to try [the Koltun code](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~kalo/papers/ShapeSynthesis/index.html) and [the UCL code](http://geometry.cs.ucl.ac.uk/projects/2015/replaceable-structures/).

The Koltun code is called SGML. OGRE is used in this code. probably try it in Linux??

### The UCL code
[The UCL code] requires [the Tao library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Framework) which is not documented in the manual of this code. The [github repo of Tao](https://github.com/mono/tao) is here, but seems is already a dead project for a while. Not sure whether the code uses the original Tao library or its child, [opentk](https://github.com/opentk/opentk). Hopefully it uses opentk, opentk is much more update-to-date. OpenTK provides [this NuGet installation instruction](http://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenTK/). From this [stackoverflow discussion](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2795442/is-the-tao-framework-dead) it seems the OpenTK is backward compatible, I can use the code with minor modification. The [original Tao](https://sourceforge.net/projects/taoframework/) can also be downloaded. This Tao installer can work well.

This code will combine two models, is it stochastic? It seems the code skeleton is what we need.

Start a git repo to track my progress.

## The Koltun code

I got an error saying CLAPACK can not be found. I can only find liblapack-dev in apt-get, is it the same thing? I need file `clapack.h`. Use `apt-file search` can tell a few packages. This is developed in windows.

This is a [more recent code](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~hbhuang/publications/bsm/).

## Siyuan discussion
- IARPA feedback
1. neuron? visual concept.


plan?

category, benchmark.

Check [the digital embroyo project](http://gandalf.psych.umn.edu/users/kersten/kersten-lab/camouflage/digitalembryo.html), to see whether it fits our requirements. [Mark Brady]() is the main person for this project.

Check that did I receive an email from Kersten?

The role for generation? composition or growing? semantic or non-semantic?
