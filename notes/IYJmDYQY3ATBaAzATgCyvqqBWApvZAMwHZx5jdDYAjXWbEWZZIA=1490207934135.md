## Import ShapeNet cars into UE4

The import speed issue? The good and bad parts of using UE4. How to make large scale manipulation possible? How did Siyuan do this? Why it took ages to do so?

Scale it to 500, uniformly. Rotate 90 along x-axis.

Is it better to convert it to fbx or dae first?

Uniform scale 100x.

Compute normal and combine mesh

Convert obj to fbx?
