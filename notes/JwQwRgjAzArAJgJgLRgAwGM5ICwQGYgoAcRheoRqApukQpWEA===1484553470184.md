# TODO: How to write a paper

Have a discussion and make sure what we need to write about. Make sure authors that will do writing fully understand what this project is about. 

Know your audiences, and explain concepts that are unfamiliar to them. For example, API. Audience will also have impact on where to put more words. It is important to use precise words. If the word is not precise enough and you have to use it. Define or explain it, for example, virtual world.
