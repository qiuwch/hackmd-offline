# Done: Free UE4 projects we can use.

In some projects, there are some special effect no supported by UnrealCV. Make sure update UnrealCV to latest version and manually check a few cases to make sure it works correctly before doing large scale experiment.

Leaves and grass might not be very accurate due to tricks for rendering

Order, recommend from high to low

1. Epic Zen Garden
2. Showdown VR demo
3. Infinity Blade: Grass Land (you already have)
4. Landscape Mountains
5. Matinee & Sequencer (indoor and very similar)
6. Xoio Berlin (too simple and not compatible with 4.12)
7. Infiltrator Demo (very large scale, might be difficult to start with)
8. Elemental Demo (same as the above)
