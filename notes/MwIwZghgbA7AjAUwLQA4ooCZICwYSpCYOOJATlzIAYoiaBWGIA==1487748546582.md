## Vittal
Pick a good viewpoint to render, what should be the interesting viewpoint?

The foreground and mask can be just the alpha channel

## With Simulation VP

Very different focus, more technical. Do they interested in open-source their code and software?

## Discussion with Roozbeh
The idea about measuring the realism and missing information [link]().
Need to talk with Roozbeh
Standard API
Benchmark challenge and dataset
OpenAI integration
The plan of Roozbeh?
Share model
Our progress on virtual supermarket
Reinforcement learning and logic inference

Our current plan is ?


1. Speed and stability, current is 10-15 fps, the goal is 50-60 fps. 
2. Collaborate to find applications, use it to create traditional dataset, follow the format of existing dataset to ensure it is easy to use. 
3. New challenge for vision, such as task driven benchmark, reasoning, etc. Integrate with OpenAI gym. 
4. Implement some feature requests, such as project matrix, better multi-camera support, collision information, etc. But we will focus on API and connecting vision with UE4, complex computation will not be included in UnrealCV and will be deferred to client, such as python code.
