It is my pleasure to recommend Qi Chen.

In this summer, Qi Chen worked with my Ph.D. student to use virtual worlds to develop computer vision algorithms. She was given challenging tasks and need to handle a complex platform unfamiliar to her. She is passionate about her research and often the first one in the lab and the last to leave. As a result, she got familiar with the platform and completed the environment setup fairly quickly.

When the project went deeper, the result was not as good as we expect. She was very patient and performed careful and detailed diagnosis on the experiment result. She figured out why the original proposal was not working well and confirmed the direction is right. She proposed a new solution based on our original proposal and it worked much better. This project is still ongoing and will be submitted to a conference.

I worked with many excellent students from Shanghai Jiaotong University. My previous Ph.D. student Leo Zhu and Postdoc. Xiaodi Hou started AI startup company Yitu and TuSimple respectively. They are both from Shanghai Jiaotong University. Though I did not spend a long time working with Qi, I found she shares the good quality of students from SJTU. She has the potential to be a good researcher.

She is doing a project about mining training data from a synthetic environment. Spent time thinking about implementation and details. Work out the details by herself.

The first one came to the lab and the last one left.
