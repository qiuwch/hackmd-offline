TODO:

Add this link to technical details section. 

2. Third party dependencies
Currently no third party dependency, but later I need to use [protobuf](https://github.com/protobuf/protobuf)

3. Build platforms:
Add this information to `*.uplugin` description file.

4. Add marketplace URL.
```
"MarketplaceURL" : "com.epicgames.launcher://ue/marketplace/content/5126e3b25c5a41f8956cd16b4c4125ac",
```

5. Update `EngineVersion` field

6. Prepare some images

Take some screenshots from a few games?

7. [Done], Complete seller information

From [this discussion](https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/2534181-form-w-9-and-f1-student). It seems I don't need W9 and I need W8-ben instead. And in the first five years, I don't need to pay interest tax? Not sure, need to double check this.
