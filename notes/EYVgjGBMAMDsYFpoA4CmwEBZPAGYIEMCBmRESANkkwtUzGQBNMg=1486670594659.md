# 2/2 Distributed Course schedule
###### tags: `ADN`

TODO: write [the project proposal for advanced distributed system](https://hackmd.io/CwVgbBBMBGkLRgGYFMDsdisdOBDZkIGuADJABxgDMAnKiFQIxA==)

Robotis simulator based on game engine. Only vision part.

- Multi-agents compete (multiple clients)
- Distributed simulation for RL (multiple servers)
- virtual robots
- Real-time cross machine optimization

- Virtual reality and game engine

- protobuf for this
- RPC for this?

- What already has in the game, modify, for tensorflow.

- Is it a research project? similar effort? See gazebo, what people already did 

Check related work?

- Airplane communication, Drone communication.
- Car communicator
- 1. mail system, 2. 
        - Robotics simulator
- Scheduling system
- Dynamic routing over network
- Time synchronization, lapse second
- Web torrent
- Security of infrastructure
- No infrastruture communication without jailbreak 
- Peer-to-peer dropbox, google drive 

Where the problem comes from, what is the problem, why it is important? Multiple machines training

Very risky projects

Check what exists and what is missing.

Problem domain, start with a problem, Software update for the web. The problem of software update.

Check the Doom project.

TODO: join mail-list

The next time: cs667

Consolidate the idea. 5 projects or 6, reduce. Spend time and resource and get something from it.

[Distributed system](http://www.cnds.jhu.edu/courses/cs437/)



What the research problems.

- Concepts. 

Distributed system, a few nodes, the communication between nodes.

Time synchronization

Parallelize the graphics or the training

cloud gaming
