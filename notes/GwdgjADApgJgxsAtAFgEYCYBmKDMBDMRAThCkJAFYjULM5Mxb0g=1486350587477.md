# Replace the battery of my old macbook

The price from Chinese vendor, 580 CNY
The raw battery price, roughly 300 CNY, but very hard to replace.
The price from Baltimore vendor. $175 = 1202 CNY
~~If I can get a 20% discount, it will be $140 = 960 CNY, which is acceptable.~~

The price is $99 + $75 * 0.8 = $160  = 1097

福利社 Price is 900

The official price is 13-inch/15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display $199 (excluding taxes)

Is the battery a genuine macbook battery?
