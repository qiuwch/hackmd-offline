# iARPA challenges

What is needed by the challenge and what [the stochastic shape generation project](https://hackmd.io/EwY2BYDMBMAYGYC0BOAhrZjwFNVNSCAEaICss4w2wwkwAbJABxA=) can provide?

A discussion is required to see [what the stochastic shapes should look like](https://hackmd.io/OwQwnAZgLBAcDMBaADAE2BRVVWI8ArGIqgMbBRQBGB8wpBAjEA==)?
