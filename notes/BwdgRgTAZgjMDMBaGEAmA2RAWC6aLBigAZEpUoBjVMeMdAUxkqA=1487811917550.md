# 2/8 Active vision problem background

## What problem we are solving



~~We don't need to sample data manually.~~

~~Why manually sample data is a problem?~~

~~We don't know how many is enough. We are not trying to tell how many is enough~~


20 category detection
100 instances
3 * 8 view -> 90 * 360
10 background (placement)
3 * lighting

20 * 100 * 24 * 10 * 3

Active sampling of human.


C * 10^1 s

C * 10^10 s

10^64 s

10^4 s

1. random sampling
2. strategy (10^4 - 2) + sampling (2)
3. strategy (10) + sampling (10^4 - 10)


## Questions
1. Infinite (approach infinity) dataset, exist or not

Infinite: big enough that computational resource can not handle it in a reasonable time.

2. Can current method effectively sample from it.
