How to clean up my git repo? Which branch is ready to merge.

Working on:
- doc  (merge)
- 4.13 (todo)
- setres (todo)
- release (what is this?)
- fix-blueprint (merge)
- perf (todo)
- cleanup (merge)
- presskey (merge)

How to compare the difference between two branchs?

How to seperate changes into different branchs? Maybe use rebase is a solution.
