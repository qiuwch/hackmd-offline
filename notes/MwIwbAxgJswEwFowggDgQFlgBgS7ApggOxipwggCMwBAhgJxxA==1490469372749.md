# UnrealCV plan

###### tags: `unrealcv`, `plan`

Make it easier to use. 1. Make the installation simpler, so that it can be installed with one click. 2. Make it support multiple platforms, this requires building it for different platforms or teach users to compile it easily.

Make it more powerful. 1. Allow the extraction of more information from the virtual scene, including more structure details, including materials, etc. To achive this, I need a better data serialization, such as json or protobuf. 2. Support some novel features, such as the bounding box generation for text and the keypoing generation for car.

Make is more robust. 1. Fix bugs from the github issues. 2. Write test to ensure the correctness of this project. 3. Find a more elegant solution for the object mask.

## Ideas

Use the OpenXR API to define a universal API for virtual intelligent agents.
