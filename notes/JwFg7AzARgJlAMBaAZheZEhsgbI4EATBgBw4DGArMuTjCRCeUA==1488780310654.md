# Report on fb cluster

Status:

Can successfully run caffe(+gpu+cudnn), tensorflow(+gpu), torch(+gpu).

The package manager is linuxbrew (http://linuxbrew.sh/)

The speed is 1/2 - 1/4 the speed of Titan X (maxwell).

The installation will take about one hour

Experiment, unless you really need them. Whether we should use linuxbrew. Discuss with Tony (cc-ed).

The usage will be documented into our wiki after a discussion with Tony.

This scripts require a few manual step during the installation. Fully automatic installation script.

Thanks for the help of Anthony.
