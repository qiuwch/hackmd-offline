<!-- - We will add BadPix. -->

<!-- 
- Test it on middle bury
The Middlebury 2014 dataset may be worth looking at for further validation:
low texture (Staircase, Umbrella, Vintage,...) 
grids/discont (Jadeplant, Bicycle, Sticks, ...)
specularity (Motorcycle, Vintage, ..). validation set. 
- No object region good to explore. 
- It requires some annotation, we will do it later. Extra labeling on some data. 
- Far bigger version of KiTTI from Raquel. might be a good choice.

Perhaps manual annotation will only be needed in a limited (sparse) number of cases in order to validate the results on synthetic images.

## Discussion 6/4

<!-- For the synthetic dataset.-->

<!-- Very simple images. -->

<!-- Appreciate the very detailed -->

<!-- The rendering is getting better and better. -->

<!-- Short the length. -->

<!-- TODO: Thanks for generally positive feedback. Address realism, related to other work and when the code will be available. Our phylosophy the realism is becoming realistic enough to begin this. Validate on the result on KITTI and will do it on other datasets. requires extra annotation. Both the dataset and the tool available. -->

<!-- TODO: P1, too long. -->

<!-- OK: The amount of money. -->

<!--Not from the 3D scenes.
How to get these regions.
Neilson and Yang.
XX provides images in different conditions, but the real images are sparse samples of all conditions and there is no way to control.
More data, no control. We can control which no one can do before.
GCPR use non-realistic synthetic data to diagnosis, it is synthetic 2D patterns without an underlying 3D scenes. 
TODO: Divide into groups. Neilson and Yang + Middlebury.
(1) Data
(2) Regions or evaluation. Object information, material property automatic compute regions? We can also incorporate these methods into our pipeline. --> <!-- Especially THE METRICS PAPER. -->
<!-- Hausler, 2D Images, no underlying 3D structure.

<!--TODO: Relate work. First sentence summary. Make it on top of the paragraph, "we are varying the 3D scene structure and material property to throughly test stereo algorithm. This type of diagnosis is not possible before because of lack of data and tools."-->


<!-- How easy to use. Give a summary of how easy to use, add the third paragraph to the first. -->

<!--"We think the BadPix metric is a useful metric which shows characteristics not observed from the EPE metric we used."
TODO: BadPix metric is a useful metric and we will include it. 
It shows similar result than Tab.2. One noticible difference is the DispNet ranks lower using BadPix, We thik it is because the estimation of DispNet is more smooth than others. So it has a lower average error but larger regions that exceed the BadPix threshold. The threshold of BadPix can be adjusted to different levels, which might lead to different ranking for DispNet. -->



<!-- How easy to use.
1. When you use it. 2. How easy to learn, -->

<!-- Misunderstand about 842f -->
