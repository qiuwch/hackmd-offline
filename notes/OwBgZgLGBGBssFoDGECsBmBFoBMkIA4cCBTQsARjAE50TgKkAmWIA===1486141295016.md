# TODO: Hopkins Ph.D. student graduation

This is a page for preparing to graduate from Hopkins. It is a long-term page and requires a lot of effort to accomplish this goal. Hopefully I will be a good researcher when I graduate.

Missing things
- The second project and second advisor, can it be a CMU professor?
- TA a course, CG will be the best option, AR and Alan's courses will be the second options
- Two system courses, check what Zack told me? This is [the general course information](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/course-info/) and this is [the list of system course](http://cs.jhu.edu/courses/courseareas.pdf) and it might change. Interesting system courses are [parallel programming]() (in fall and spring), [object oriented programming](http://pl.cs.jhu.edu/oose) (only in fall), .

This is the [official requirements](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/graduate-studies/phd-requirements/) for a PhD student. Check this frequently to make sure I am on the right track.

The 17 spring I might take, [Advanced Distributed Systems & Networks](http://www.cnds.jhu.edu/courses/cs667/), Compilers & Interpreters, Parallel programming.
