I have to miss the first few lectures.

What is the deadline for adding and droping courses? Do I still want to wait for parallel computing? Is this an important course for me?

The course website of 

[The advanced distributed system course]()

[The compiler course](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~phf/2017/spring/cs328/) is a system course, so maybe worth taking it.

[The PHF website](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~phf/)

Possibly but not very likely the parallel computing course.

I am considering dropping the compiler course and change it to audit. It is not very relevant to what I am doing.
