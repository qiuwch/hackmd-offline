# Friend

Need five to ten minutes to start the conversation. Good taste, proper clothes. 

What can we do together? This is limited if not driving in the U.S.

Where to meet new friends. The Make lab of Hopkins. Swimming pool. A course. Collaboration. Going out to participate in an event.


Who do I want to talk to, if I have something to say.

what am I looking from a girlfriend. not cooking, not cleaning house. but share the opinion of the world. and go to see the world together.

I found many friends in renren that I don't have a connection anymore.

Use facebook better to find information that I really care about.

Talking is a way to keep active. Enough talking during weekdays, so in the weekend, it is not that important.

Events or party hold by friends.

What will others do during weekend and for fun?
