# Alexa

alexa is stupid. If you ask "sing a song" it can response. But if you ask "sing two songs" if won't understand what to do. This is similar to the challenges we have in the reinforcement learning tasks. If the model can work well on one situation, can it also extend to another? Is the experience shared?
