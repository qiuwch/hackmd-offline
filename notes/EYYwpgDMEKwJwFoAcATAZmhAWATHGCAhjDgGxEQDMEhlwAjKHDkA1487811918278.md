The bias in the testing data. Do we want a good performance on all cases? If real test dataset only contain a few cases. 

Given we know the real image distribution, can we have a better strategy?
The real distribution is $P_r$. The uniform distribution is $P_u$.

Is there a benchmark in which we need to handle the uniform distribution $P_u$?
