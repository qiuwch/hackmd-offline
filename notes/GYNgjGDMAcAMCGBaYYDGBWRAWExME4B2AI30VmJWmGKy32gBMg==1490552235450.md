How to write a learning algorithm for a gym environment

How to play an environment with mouse and keyboard, can I?

If we want to start from [the CartPole environment](), it is saved in `envs/classic_control/cartpole.py`. I need to be familiar with it.

`render_mode`, `human`, `rgb_array`. difference?

What if I change the property of this Cartpole environment, can I still work well?? TODO: this is an interesting question to ask.

Constrain the models 

`examples/agents/keyboard_agent.py` an agent to use keyboard to interact with the environment.
