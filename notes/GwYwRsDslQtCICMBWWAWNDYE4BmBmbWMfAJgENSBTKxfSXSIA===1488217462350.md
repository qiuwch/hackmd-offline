Make sure the problem is in a managable size.

The long time strategy and the short time.

The most important thing is showing the community the usefulness of virtual environments and encourage people to use it. There are different challenges for different tasks.

For example:

For stereo, it does not require high level semantic information (at least for some methods), so we might not need as big and variant environments as semantic segmentations.

Also an interesting direction is summarizing the challenges and directions of how to improve virtual environments. What is a cost-effective way, we should be done by us and what should be done by the community.

## Correlation analysis
region based? for understanding the network. Real and virtual correspondence?

Maybe use face is easier than other objects, if I can get very realistic faces, then I can do this task.
