# 2/7 Initial stage of the VDL project

###### tags: `VDL`

TODO: Run the code, OpenAI gym. https://gym.openai.com/. Discuss the technical issues of setup in Slack. Pick a demo to get a feel of reinforecement learning on a virtual environment. Start from [this tutorial](https://gym.openai.com/docs)
TODO: Read paper [Nair, Arun, et al. "Massively parallel methods for deep reinforcement learning." arXiv preprint arXiv:1507.04296 (2015).](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04296) 
TODO: Read paper [Mnih, Volodymyr, et al. "Asynchronous methods for deep reinforcement learning." International Conference on Machine Learning. 2016.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01783). This paper has code, but we don't need it yet.
TODO: If interested in Realistic virtual environments. You can download a demo (the one I show in the class) from https://unrealcv.org and follow the tutorial to see what it provides.

Added: 2/9
TODO: Setup development environment, Analyze what we need to implement.
TODO: Figure out a baseline to compare.

Added: 2/11
TODO: Read the project report of distributed system of the last semister.

## Schedule

I can give a presentation about [reinforcement learning]() next week to give some background knowledge of it. Also we need to discuss the plan for the next stage.

## Misc.

TODO: Think a name for this project?
