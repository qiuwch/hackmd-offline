# Calendar

Schedule view and week view are the two most important features.

## PC

The best solution is online version + client.

The best client is thunderbird, cross-platform and can easily add event from email.

## Mobile

The best option in mobile (iOS) is fantasical. Good features are: adding event with natural language, clean UI.

## Misc.

How to use the google calendar system. Use thunderbird - lighting system, it is platform and provides consistent user experience, which is extremely important.

When I subscribe to a new calendar, I need to make it visible to my clients. How to do that? Sometimes is because my client did not refresh yet, sometimes is about setting issue.

I can manually refresh mac client, not sure about the others.

My SIS calendar is used as `delegate`?  Fairly strange.

Seems no way to [update the ios calendar](https://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/ios-refreshing-icloud-contacts-calendars) manually. 

[In iOS I can only see a portion of my calendars](www.makeuseof.com/tag/google-calendar-wont-sync-ios-try-fixes/), not sure about the criteria.

I seems there is a secret place to configure calendar sharing.

do calendar subscription through google calendar if possible.

This is an issue about [avoiding sending invitations 6 years ago](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/calendar/v96g68hPrz0)

The stupid google calendar will try to send invitation to everyone. While the thunderbird calendar is more intelligent and more friendly.
