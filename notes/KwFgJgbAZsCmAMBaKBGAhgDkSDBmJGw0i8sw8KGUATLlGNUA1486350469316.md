# Fun in JHU

Watch squid jumping around in the campus, study different types of trees and flowers.

Relax and spend time cleaning house, do not just thinking of going outside.

This is a very systematic page to find out what interesting things I can do for relaxation. Also it is important to enjoy a day off at home for playing music or cleaning my house, etc.

Playing Guitar, playing piano and going to places I want to go are also good options. [Swimming](https://hackmd.io/EYdgnArAHMBmYFoAsAmAbG5aUFMHABMBmKBAYxwEY0kAGEJAQzKiSA==) is always a good option.

go to practice driving is also a good option.

Listen to music or playing music. The important thing is relaxing and thinking instead of working whenever I can. Meditation is something I need.

Solve rubik cube.

go hiking

The baltimore zoo?

Any TV I can watch? LeTV or PPS? Mobile app is more popular than mac app.


## Events

[The JHU hub](http://hub.jhu.edu/) is a general place for event announcement. Use [the event page](http://hub.jhu.edu/events/) to directly locate what will happen today.

The DMC [digital media center](http://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/dmc/) is another place to find interesting things. I am interested in their 3D printer. [The DMC event](http://hub.jhu.edu/channels/digital-media-center/events/) is hosted seperately. Not a lot for one semester.

Shriver Hall has regular [Shriver Hall concerts](http://www.shriverconcerts.org/) with very good quality.

Also, check what the BMA (Baltimore Art Meseum) can provide?

There might also be other things to consider, like some events hosted by the gym, etc. 

## Regular visiting

[Go to exercise](https://hackmd.io/EYdgnArAHMBmYFoAsAmAbG5aUFMHABMBmKBAYxwEY0kAGEJAQzKiSA==) is usually a good idea for relax. Go to BMA and sitting there for nothing is also an idea.

Will it take a long time to find what to do?
