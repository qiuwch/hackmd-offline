# An email draft to AirSim team

[The AirSim project](https://hackmd.io/KzBMFMA4GN2haA7AIwIwE54BZKgGzyTDQCG8yADHietACbrgXqhA?both)


The project and paper

Robotics and computer vision background.

Many things to do together. Computer vision background and robotics background.

Hi, AirSim team:

My name is Weichao Qiu, the developer of UnrealCV, an UE4 plugin for computer vision research (https://github.com/unrealcv/unrealcv) and a Ph.D. student of Johns Hopkins University. I saw your project AirSim and found we are interested in using UE4 for very similar tasks. 

In our lab, we use the synthetic images from UE4 to diagnose binocular stereo algorithms by changing hazardous factors, such as the reflectancy and transparency of objects (https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04647). The UnrealCV project is published in ECCV16 workshop VARVAI (https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01326). We would appreciate if you can cite our papers.

I also wonder what we can do together for the community. We can discuss how to make the code faster considering the limitation of UE4, write documentation of UE4 to help researchers get started easier. Let me know if you think there is anything we can do together.

My advisor, distinguished professor Alan Yuille and I strongly believe there will be a lot of potential of synthetic images. We want to create integrated vision systems that can help us solve real world problems.

<!-- The convergence between computer vision and robotics. We designed our projects for computer vision researchers, while you did it for robotics. -->

<!-- It is interesting to see researchers from different computer vision and robotics background both utilize realistic virtual environments in research. -->

Hi, AirSim team:

My name is Weichao Qiu, the developer of UnrealCV, an open source UE4 plugin for computer vision research (https://github.com/unrealcv/unrealcv), and a Ph.D. student at Johns Hopkins University. I saw your project AirSim and realized that we are interested in using UE4 for very similar tasks.  We come from the computer vision community but we are also interested in robotics. We are hoping to enable a community of researchers which use this type of virtual environment.

UnrealCV was published in an ECCV16 workshop VARVAI (https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01326). In more recent work, we used synthetic images from UE4 to diagnose binocular stereo algorithms by
changing hazardous factors, such as the reflectance and transparency of objects (https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04647).

I wonder what we can do together for the community? Perhaps we can discuss how to make the code faster, taking into account the limitations of UE4, write documentation of UE4 to help researchers get started easily, write tutorials such as how to package a game, provide linux support, etc. Let me know if you think there is anything we can do together.

My adviser, Alan Yuille (a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor at JHU) and I strongly believe there is enormous potential for the use of synthetic images for vision and robotics and are very enthusiastic about this type of research.
