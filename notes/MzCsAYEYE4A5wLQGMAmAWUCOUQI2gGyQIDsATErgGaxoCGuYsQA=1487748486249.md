# The grand plan for UnrealCV.

###### tags: `unrealcv`

My rule is connecting computer vision to computer graphics community. I am not trying to push computer graphics forward. But I need to know what is the best in the graphics community. I need to know some visual artists. Even though I don't want to be very graphics, I have to do this. The grants in alanlab will require me to have the knowledge setting up very complex simulation environment.

I need to find a place I can collaborate with others, so that I can show my power. The current status of computer graphics. What is enough and what is missing?

Why photorealistic rendering important for computer vision? Or is it really important?

What I need to learn about Unreal. Do I need to learn how to render humans? not really.

If let me choose between FAIR and Oculus, which one will I choose? Oclus maybe.

My ranking will be DeepMind > OpenAI > Oculus > Baidu > FAIR.

- I need to be familiar with the rendering pipeline.
- I need to be familiar with the content creation pipeline.
- How to simulate non-rigid objects. I can extend from human to animal. Scene and furniture is not very hard and why I say Unreal is powerful, because it is based on VR.
- How to do physics simulation
- How to do object interaction
- How to get complex information from a virtual scene (with protobuf maybe)


Why try to find an internship?
- Money? not really
- Meet more people
- Learn what company is doing?
- Open my eye?

CMU is a nice place
Zoox is a nice place
Baidu IDL is a nice place
JHU is a nice place

The importance for AI
- The basic computational theory, knowledge representation
- The tool for these research
- The applications that focuses on getting performance gain
