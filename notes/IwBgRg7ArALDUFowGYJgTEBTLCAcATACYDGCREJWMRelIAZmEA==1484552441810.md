###### tags: `unrealcv` `cvpr17`

Compare with existing dataset.

## Some questions to address in our paper
- What is the advantage of our data?

Compare with other stereo dataset, we can control the rendering parameter to test challenging cases.

- Why using this data is important?

Can help us understand the failure cases and avoid further failure. The Tesla crash.

- Our contribution?

Propose a framework to dianose computer vision algorithm. To be more specific, we diagnose stereo algorithms but categoring different algorithms with their failure cases. So that we can understand why and when they will fail.
